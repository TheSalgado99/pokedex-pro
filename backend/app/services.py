# Business Logic Layer
# Functions for fetching data, calculations, interacting with external APIs, DB, etc.

# Example function structure:
# async def fetch_album_collection_for_user(collection_id: str, user: User):
#    # 1. Get base collection data (from DB or external API like PokemonTCG.io)
#    # 2. Get user's owned cards for this collection (from DB)
#    # 3. Get current market prices (from Price APIs/DB cache)
#    # 4. Combine data, calculate owned value, etc.
#    # 5. Return data structured according to Pydantic models (e.g., UserAlbumCollection)
#    pass

# Add functions for:
# - Card recognition/grading (interfacing with AI model)
# - Price fetching and updating
# - ROI calculation
# - Pack opening simulation logic
# - PSA verification scraping (if chosen, with caveats)
